# todo-app

This is a simple to-do list application that is trying to be built with Flask.

## what to do?

I tried to build this application in the hope that I could use it to overcome my concentration problems.
I have trouble focusing on what I'm doing or what I want to achieve.
I would be very happy and grateful if anyone would help or contribute to developing this to function as expected.

## Why not use an existing application??

I think, I'm not here for that..
After all, I'm also one of you, who enjoys things from another point of view

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
